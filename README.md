## Section 1: Probabilities
**Objectives**
* Represent probability variables as a number between 0-100, representing the percent chance of said thing happening, eg. coinHeads = 50
* And logic for probabilities, representing the probability of a AND b happening, eg. and_prob 50 50 = 25
* Or logic for probabilities, representing the probability of a OR b happening, eg. or_prob 50 50 = 75
* Get odds of x getting 'and'ed n times, eg. and_of_x_n_times_prob 50 2 = 25, and_of_x_n_times_prob 50 4 = 6.25
* Get odds of x getting 'or'ed n times, eg. or_of_x_n_times_prob 50 2 = 75, or_of_x_n_times_prob 50 4 = 93.75
